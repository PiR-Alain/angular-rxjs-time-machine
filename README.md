# Build Redux Style Applications with Angular2, RxJS, and ngrx/store

## Summary
Angular 2 has many built-in features for working closely with RxJS to help you build fully reactive applications. This course will teach you how to use Angular 2 with RxJS. We will learn how to use the `ngrx/store` library to manage state in a very clean reactive "Redux style".

This course assumes you've got a working knowledge of Angular 2 and reactive programming with RxJS. If you don't, you might want to watch [Angular 2 Fundamentals](https://egghead.io/series/angular-2-fundamentals) and this [Introduction to Reactive Programming with RxJS](https://egghead.io/series/introduction-to-reactive-programming). You might also enjoy [Step by Step Async Programming with RxJS](https://egghead.io/series/step-by-step-async-javascript-with-rxjs) and this course on [Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) by its creator Dan Abramov!
